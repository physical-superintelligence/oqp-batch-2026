# Strong continuity of the bounded quadratic resolvent

Only strong convergence of the selfadjoint inputs is required. The exact
resolvent identity multiplies the two input differences at fixed vectors
by uniformly bounded operators. No uniform norm bound on the inputs, or
strong convergence of their squares, is used.
