# Numerical parameters of Sections 7 and 8

The fixed parameters of the manuscript, equations `eq:reverse-exponents` (7.10),
`eq:orders` (8.1) and `eq:completion-exponents` (8.15), together with the elementary
arithmetic facts asserted about them, and two scalar bounds used in the proof of
Theorem 7.2 and in (8.13).

These are statements about explicit real numbers only; they involve no field-theoretic
content.
