# Containing-region bounds for the actual completed source spaces

The source inclusion is the constructed isometry of the covariance
completions. Compression of its actual Gram identifies the normalized
commutation operator; the weighted-mean inequality then bounds the full
bounded source weight. For bounded nonempty open containing regions this
is transported to the physical modular power, with domain membership.
No wedge modular identification is claimed here.
