# A full partial operator is determined by its bounded resolvent

The universal resolvent equation retains the entire graph, including its
domain. We use it to prove independence of two bounded ratio representations
whose numerators and denominators give the same cross product. This is the
regularizer-independence step for an extended continuous functional calculus.
