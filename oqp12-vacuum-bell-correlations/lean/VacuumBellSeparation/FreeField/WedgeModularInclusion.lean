# The genuine containing-left-wedge estimate on original completed sources

The bounded Gram compression estimate and the proved full wedge modular
identification yield an actual graph vector, with its norm bounded by the
smaller region's source weight. The region and source may be arbitrary;
the only localization premise is literal containment in the halfspace.
