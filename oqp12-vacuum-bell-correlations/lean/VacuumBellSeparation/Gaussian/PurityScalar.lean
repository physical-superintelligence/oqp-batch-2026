# The scalar factor in Gaussian Rényi purity

For the manuscript's covariance normalization (pure symplectic eigenvalue `1/2`),
the scalar factor is `fᵣ(x) = (x + 1/2)^r - (x - 1/2)^r`.
This file proves its logarithmic derivative bound, including the pure boundary.
It does not assume differentiability of ordered symplectic eigenvalue branches,
or identify an operator trace with a product of these scalar factors.
