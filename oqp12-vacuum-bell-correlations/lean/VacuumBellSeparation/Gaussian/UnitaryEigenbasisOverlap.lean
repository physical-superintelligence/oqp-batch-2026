# Actual unitary overlaps between finite eigenbases

The squared absolute entries of an actual unitary matrix have unit row
and column sums. They give the exact real diagonal and mixed trace under
unitary conjugation. These finite identities are the ingredients for a
spectral trace Taylor estimate that does not differentiate eigenbranches.
