# Complete copositivity does not imply complete positivity

Transposition on `M_2` is completely copositive (`t ∘ t = id`) but not completely positive (the
partial transpose of the unnormalized maximally entangled operator has a negative eigenvalue).
The definition `IsPPTMap` therefore requires both properties.
